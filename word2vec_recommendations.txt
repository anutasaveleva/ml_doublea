Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick  
and kicks it quick, you know how black niggaz get  
with the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees  
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's  
Hittin buckshots at niggaz that open spots  
on the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you  
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos  
Flash the roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose  
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox  
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks  
Just in case a nigga wanna act out  
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out  
That's a real nigga for ya

Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried  
That's a real nigga for ya  
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer  
Spit at the D.A., cause fuck what she say  
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway

of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill  
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover  
Ha hahhh, yo G, pass the ruler

The neighborhood gravedigga  
Gettin paid so much, all the bitches wanna see a nigga  
I guess they figure I'm paid, I wanna get laid  
or since I got loot I wanna knock boots  
I'd rather beat my dick than trick  
and if she don't suck then we don't fuck  
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck  
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck  
Yes, flex at the two or three Benzes  
I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?  
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy  
from Bed-Stuy, puttin the swellin on your eye  
and your nose even, when I choke ya you stop breathin  
And when Jake come, I'm leavin!

Fuck a hand shake nigga we ain't brothers  
On that West side where they reppin for they colors  
If you talking big shit, then my dick will make you stutter  
All up in your face like its (...)  
Right now, make her scream my name and pipe her right down  
Nasty I'm a king bitch, give a nigga a wipedown  
Twenty four bitches, I'm rolling on chrome  
My niggas are smoking on that loud  
Bitch try to flunt, Imma blow your back out  
I ain't thinking bout a nigga that walk past you  
Bitch stole my blunt and said she love my tatoos

But when she driving on that dick she a damn fool

It's a habit, in the club bottle magic  
Fucking with these ratchets no purses they got baskets  
Its a hand out, bitches(...)guess they addicts  
And I ask them are you in like Patrick  
Playing with the pussy like it's madden  
Fire like a dragon  
One say she like me then they all bandwagon  
Been leadin as hoes, but they pretty like a pageant  
She said she'd let me cut, I had to stab it, for real though

Never cop bottles, with broke niggas  
In the corner, post it up(or pour shit up), what the dome give her  
Money flowin like a wet pussy, that's a long river  
So you got your bitch on lock, I'll slim jim her  
It's that time of the month fuck timber  
All my niggas got a bottle with a blunt lit up  
Before you pop up, throw your set up  
(hop in this bitch, lights lit up?), leave with her, a big spender, (bitch

(...)Illuminati all through your body  
She blow me like a twelve gang shawty you feel me

Will he make the beats up? Nigga what?  
And 24th Street rip  
But even blood niggas got dubs on my shit  
And thug niggas on the south side  
Slam X-Raided loc when they out ridin'  
I'm the king of this Sac-Town scene and you peasant  
I ran shit in the past well in the future and the present  
Yo Meek attempt to diss me you's a boy  
I knew you back when you was broke wearin' Bugle Boys  
Now you got tattoos ooh! You big killa  
I won't hesitate to slap you, you still a bitch nigga  
Which nigga want to war with the hardcore  
Load up you .44 playa what cha waitin' for  
Lay a motha fucka face down  
With bullet holes in your clothes  
Decapitated and naked from the waist down

I send letters from the pen to my true locs  
It's time to ride my nigga go out and shoot folks  
Incarceration ain't workin'  
My body's locked but my souls on the streets lurkin'  
Perkin' niggas like Folgers, motivatin' soldiers  
To make you set look like yo set got wrecked with bulldozers  
How many marks can I take in one day?  
I'ma need a little help don't trip it's on the way, hey!  
Display your corpse in the window like a mannequin  
Why damagin'

Flame a missile through your temple till your brain gristles  
Dead issues

You used to be a rip now you claim damu  
You dog niggas didn't know but nigga I do

Put your ass in a urn cremated nigga burned  
Howard Stern couldn't clown a nigga worse than Raided  
Let loose a few verses had you cursed and faded  
Like Madusa on the loop I'm turnin' true to the stone  
Spittin' brimstone burnin' motha fuckas to bone  
If it's on I'ma show you how to end this shit  
Chrome .50 caliber "Des Eags" with extended clips bitch  
  
Chorus

song      Ridiculous
Ridiculous, it's hilarious  
How your girl gon stare at kid at all the frozen karots, dig it?  
Ain't no comparison, the clarity is excellent  
Brightlin cost your budget, bitch. That's why a nigga flexin it.  
Coulda bought a mini mansion, but I bought a necklace  
Coulda bought a Bentley, but instead I bought a chevorlet  
Donk is still ridiculous, it's sittin on switches bitch.  
Naw, don't make no switches, bitch. It's chrome lipstick 26's.  
Trap house with bout 20 kitchens, 20 chickens, 20 minutes  
20 chickens, 20 minutes and I'm gon scratch out every penny  
2'll make a 3 and that 1 will break another 20  
I was gettin it, I'll admit it  
But right now I extra get it  
Mvp Champ, my statistics I jus scored a triple double  
Cocaine, kush, and ecstacy, my trap is guaranteed to bubble.  
Cocaine, kush, and ecstacy, my trap is guaranteed to bubble.

Ridiculous bitch, and she got ridiculous brain  
She ridiculous thick, I don't remember her name  
Ridiculous dog, gotta treat these hoes the same  
Might take her to Lennox, I might buy her a purse  
She gon fuck all my niggas, she gon ride wit that work  
Ridiculous whip, ridiculous crib  
Ridiculous life, bitch this is the way that I live  
You a hater, dick in the ass taker  
Fake ass gangster, wit a fake ass Jacob  
Not scared nigga, look at the shit you make up  
Cocaine cowboy, look at the shit I shake up

[Ice Cube]  
Ice Cube motherfucker  
West coast motherfucker  
  
George Bush, George Clinton, Bill Clinton  
Chris Farley, Chris Rock, Bob Marley  
Rick James, knew how to throw a party  
"Smoke some weed!"  
Snoop Dogg, all the way to Cheech and Chong  
Cypress Hill, Robert Downey hit the bong  
Ricky Williams, fuck how Miami feeling  
"Smoke some weed!"  
  
[Chorus: Ice Cube]  
This is West coast nigga thinking  
California quicksand got a nigga sinking  
I can give a fuck what you niggas drinking  
"Smoke some weed!"  
This is West coast nigga thinking  
California quicksand got a nigga sinking  
I can give a fuck what you bitches drinking  
"Smoke some weed!"  
  
[Ice Cube]  
If you a baller, nigga I'm a hall of famer  
Lion tamer, with two fo'-fifth flamers  
Understand, that yo' life's in danger  
Didn't your momma, tell you not to talk to strangers  
Lil' nigga, I'm the Hillside Strangler  
Have a banger, calling for the Lone Ranger  
Most rappers, they wanna fuck sangers  
I'm a nigga, that wanna bone T'Penga  
G4, pull it up out the hanger  
A lil' something, to fuel you niggas anger  
The swine, I'm your face rearranger  
In a mansion cause Jesus born in a manger  
Motherfucker, belong on Jerry Springer  
I'm a gangsta, up in your CD changer  
I'll gank ya, for 20 bucks then I'll thank ya  
Police, still get the middle finger  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Ice Cube]  
Lil' niggas, don't try this at home  
Momma in the bathroom leave her ass alone  
Cause she probably taking chronic straight to the dome  
Go play you lil' fucker, stop being grown  
Dave Chappelle, 50 million and a throne  
With a big Zulu bitch, nigga getting blown  
Watch your tone, if your wear Coppertone  
Go back to Africa used to be a theme song  
I'm in the zone, do anybody got a zone  
I ain't your poppa, but daddy is a rolling stone  
You'se a clone, who don't know the shit you on  
Unless it's on, a motherfucking ringtone  
I'm in a room with two bottles of Patron  
You need a loan, to fuck with the Family Stone  
Nigga go on, tell 'em Ice Cube is home  
Gorilla niggas, here come King Kong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Ice Cube]  
Ice Cube motherfucker  
West coast motherfucker  
"Smoke some weed!"
